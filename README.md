1. What is the purpose of your project (i.e., why would someone use this app)?
This project serves the purpose to display the best projects I have worked on (which is why I do not include all of the projects from this class). Other people should be able to visit this site and get a sense of my skills, and contact me if they would like to.

2. What is the URL of this project on your student web-server?
http://students.washington.edu/iriscsun/info343/build/#/

3. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc.)? If so, please list who.
Daniel and Material UI

4. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge?
~15 hours

5. Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better?
Material UI was confusing to use, didn't realize I had to wrap everything in the muithemeprovider tag, also react materialize was not working so that was frustrating as well.
